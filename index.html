        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            Mastering a craft is something I always want to achieve and on my web development journey it will be
            challenging but having good mentors , and even better classmates will make it easier for everyone
            involved. I believe there is 3 things that make a good student.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>being a good listener</li>
            <li>not being afraid to ask questions</li>
            <li>build good relationships with those around you</li>
        </ol>
